Problem Statement

Given that January 1, 1990 falls on a Monday, determine which weekday a given
date (restricted to the years 1990-1999) falls on.

The program will take as input three integers representing a valid month, day,
and year, from the years 1990-1999. The output will be a string containing a
case sensitive day of the week :

         (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

Here are the number of days for each month in 1990-1999 :

(Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Aug, Oct, Dec) = 31; (Apr, Jun, Sep, Nov) = 30;
(Feb)=28 except on 1992, 1996 (Feb)=29  (leap year)

NOTE : You are not allowed to use any external libraries for this problem
       (ie no import statements)

Here is the method signature :

public String getDay(int month, int day, int year);

We will check to make sure the input to this problem is valid.

Output : Monday
