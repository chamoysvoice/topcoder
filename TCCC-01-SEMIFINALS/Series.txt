Problem Statement

Class Name: Series
Method Name: increasingLength
Paramaters: int[]
Returns: int

Implement a class Series, which contains a method increasingLength.
increasingLength takes an int[] and returns the length of the largest strictly
increasing sequence in the int[].  A strictly increasing sequence is a sequence
of numbers such that every number in the sequence after the first is strictly
greater than the number before it.

Here is the method signature:
public int increasingLength(int[] data);

*The int[] will contain Integers between -10000 and 10000, inclusive.
*The int[] will have at least 1 element and at most 1000 elements.

Note:
*A single element of the int[] is a strictly increasing sequence of size 1.
*Read the int[] in the order in which element 0 is before element 1...

Examples:
*If the int[] is {-4, 5, -2, 0 , 4 , 5 , 9 ,9}, the method should return 5.
*If the int[] is {1,0} the method should return 1.
